    We may want a middle ground though. The best way to do this is add the
    entire ruleset, then rule by rule, remove ones that don't suit a project. We
    can do this by running `phpcs` with the '-s' flag, to see the names of the
    different Sniffs, as their rules are broken. From here, we can opt to
    exclude problematic sniffs like so.
  <exclude name="WordPress.XSS.EscapeOutput"/>

	<exclude-pattern>*/dev-lib/*</exclude-pattern>
	<exclude-pattern>*/node_modules/*</exclude-pattern>
	<exclude-pattern>*/vendor/*</exclude-pattern>
</ruleset>
